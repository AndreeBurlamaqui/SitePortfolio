title: "Gridnight"
description: "Worktest made in 48h. Task: Develop a polished prototype featuring a character movement, animation, and world interaction. Must implement slot-based UI inventory that supports drag-and-drop, swapping, and item usage (equipping/consuming). The system must include a data persistence layer to save and load inventory states and slot positions. To stand out, enhance the project with creative world-building elements like VFX, sound, and level design."

## About the Project
Write a brief introduction here. What is the game? What was the core hook?

## My Contribution
Focus on what **YOU** did. Since you are a Lead, talk about:
* Architecture decisions.
* Team management or code reviews.
* Specific complex systems you built (e.g., the inventory system, the optimization pipeline).

## Technical Challenges
* **Challenge 1:** Describe a hard bug or performance issue.
* **Solution:** How you fixed it.
