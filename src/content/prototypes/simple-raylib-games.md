## About the Project
Write a brief introduction here. What is the game? What was the core hook?

## My Contribution

* Team management or code reviews.
* Specific complex systems you built (e.g., the inventory system, the optimization pipeline).

## Technical Challenges
* **Challenge 1:** Describe a hard bug or performance issue.
* **Solution:** How you fixed it.
