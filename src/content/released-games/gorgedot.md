title: "Gorgedot"
description: "Protect both your life and the nexus (your family) from a human raid on your dungeon. As a slime, use abilities to attack and dash that drain your goop (life), while absorbing weakened enemies to restore your strength. Use all of the enemies' weapons against them. However, the weapons you hold won't last long inside your goop and will soon be fully dissolved. Use them quickly and replace with new weapons."
