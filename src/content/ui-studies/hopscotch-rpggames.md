## About the Project
This project was developed as part of an internal Research & Development initiative. Due to strict non-disclosure agreements (NDA), specific client details and strategic applications cannot be shared. However, these prototypes serve to demonstrate our technical capabilities in UI architecture and the specific visual styles or game genres requested by the client.

## My Contribution
Focus on what **YOU** did. Since you are a Lead, talk about:
* Architecture decisions.
* Team management or code reviews.
* Specific complex systems you built (e.g., the inventory system, the optimization pipeline).

## Technical Challenges
* **Challenge 1:** Describe a hard bug or performance issue.
* **Solution:** How you fixed it.
